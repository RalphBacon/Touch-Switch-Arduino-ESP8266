As part of my Home Alone project, I need a touch switch. Here are two ways of doing that.

I've implemented a capacitive touch sensor three times in my Arduino-based projects, and they work flawlessly. And, considering you only need one wire and have no switch bounce, they are infinitely preferable to standard, mechanical, push-button switches, IMHO.

So it seemed a no-brainer to do the same for my Home Alone project. If only life were that easy! Watch the video to find out why I couldn't do this on my Wemos D1 Mini project, and see a demo of the Arduino-based touch switch that I've used before.
